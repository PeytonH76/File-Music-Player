# Overview

This project I worked on and completed is a program that will play music. The user gets an option to add a song by giving the file path
and name of the song, and the user can have the program generate a random song, display a list of songs, or choose a song to play.
The program will save the song list to a file and read from it when ever the program is started. This project as helped
me to gain the skill of learning a new programming language faster than normal. I have
not fully learned C++, but I have gotten a good ground knowledge of the language. I wanted to write this type of 
software for my own purpose and to learn C++. I wanted to have C++ under my belt, and I 
wanted to do something I'm interested in.

# Development Environment

I used multiple tools such as a map tool, memory tool, random tool, time tool, and some other tools. The map tool was to help me
have multiple data for a single song. I could add the artist and the file path to the same set. Then I could have multiple songs with a file path and 
song name. I then used a memory tool which would make the program remember what was inserted from the add song class.  I then used fstream 
to write and read a file so that any songs added would be remembered.  I used the time tool and random tool to be able to generate random songs and play them.
C++ seems to be a very flexible programming language. It is also very good for performance capabilities.

# Future Work

- Add an option to delete a song from the text file
- Add a way the user can add a song without entering a file path
- Put the load and save file in different classes# File-Music-Player
